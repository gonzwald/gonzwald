Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional | Linux Homelab & Secure Networking Labs

## About

I build structured homelab environments to develop practical experience in Linux system administration, secure networking, and foundational cybersecurity practices.

My approach focuses on breaking down complex technical concepts into controlled, repeatable lab exercises. Each project is executed hands-on and documented step-by-step to reinforce clarity, discipline, and operational understanding.

The goal is not just to perform tasks — but to understand, validate, and explain them.
