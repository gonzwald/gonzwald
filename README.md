Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional | Linux Homelab & Secure Networking Labs

## About

I build structured homelab environments to develop practical experience in Linux system administration, secure networking, and foundational cybersecurity practices.

My approach focuses on breaking down complex technical concepts into controlled, repeatable lab exercises. Each project is executed hands-on and documented step-by-step to reinforce clarity, discipline, and operational understanding.

The goal is not just to perform tasks — but to understand, validate, and explain them.

I leverage AI-assisted workflows to enhance documentation quality, generate structured explanations, refine technical clarity, and streamline visual asset creation — while maintaining full hands-on implementation and validation of every environment.
